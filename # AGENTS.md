# AGENTS.md

## Output Format
- Always ensure any code, cli commands, hyper text, markdown etc is formatted appropriately if the goal is to portray that format to the user
    - For example, use `some code here` for inline code
    - and triple single quotes for python or other language code blocks
    ```python 
    some python code between ```python and ```
    ``` 
- Always suggest a testing routine, IF the Agent cannot complete it on their end (ie doesn't have access to browser or WSL etc)
